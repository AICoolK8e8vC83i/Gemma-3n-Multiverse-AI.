## 📝 **Scenario 1: Nigeria Student - Exact Text to Type**

```
I'm a 16-year-old student in Lagos, Nigeria. I want to understand quantum physics but our textbooks are outdated and we have no internet most days. How can I learn advanced physics when I don't have access to modern resources?
```

**Expected Proactive Intelligence:**
- Round 1: "Analyze offline learning strategies for advanced physics"
- Round 2: "Create personalized quantum physics curriculum using local materials" 
- Round 3: "Identify practical experiments possible in resource-limited environment"

**Goal Suggestions:**
- "Build offline physics laboratory using household items"
- "Connect with local university physics departments"
- "Create peer-to-peer learning network"

## 🎤 **Scenario 2: Bangladesh Teacher - Audio Script**

**Record this in slightly accented English:**

```
"Hello, I am a teacher in rural Bangladesh. I teach 50 incredibly brilliant students, but they lack access to modern educational resources. These children have so much potential - some solve complex math problems faster than university students. How can I help them compete globally and reach their full potential when we have limited internet and old textbooks?"
```

**Expected Response Theme:**
- Personalized learning paths for each student
- Offline curriculum development
- Talent identification and nurturing strategies
- Global competition preparation without internet dependency
